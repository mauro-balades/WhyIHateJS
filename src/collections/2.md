title: An infinite timeout
---

## Are we there yet?

This might be a very confused line for beginer programmers and people who don't watch JavaScript memes. The unexpected thing that `will` happen is that the following `console.log` will execute inmidiately.

```js
setTimeout(() => console.log("called"), Infinity); // -> <timeoutId>
```

#### Why does this happen?

Usually, runtime stores the delay as a 32-bit signed integer internally. This causes an integer overflow, resulting in the timeout being executed immediately.
