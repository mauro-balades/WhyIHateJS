title: Nan is not equal to NaN
---

## `Nan` != `NaN`

```js
NaN === NaN; // -> false
```

#### Why does this happen?

The specification strictly defines the logic behind this behavior:

> 1. If Type(x) is different from Type(y), return false.
> 1. If Type(x) is Number, then
>       1. If x is NaN, return false.
>       2. If y is NaN, return false.
>       3. … … …

Following the definition of `NaN` from the `IEEE`:

> Four mutually exclusive relations are possible: less than, equal, greater than, and unordered. The last case arises when at least one operand is NaN. Every > NaN shall compare unordered with everything, including itself.
