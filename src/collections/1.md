## Javascript is bananas

Here's a "simple" line of JavaScript code:

```js
console.log(('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase());
```

what do you think it will output? The answer is that it will output `banana`. This has been a joke around the javascript comunity for a while and it really shows how javascript not giving a sh*t about types.

#### Why does this happen?

Firstly, `'b'` is concatenated with `'a'`, resulting in `'ba' + + 'a' + 'a'`. So far so good.


Now things get interesting. The next expression is `+ + 'a'`. The first `+` is a concatenation operation just like the previous one, but then it finds another `+` sign, followed by `'a'`, a string. The `+ 'a'` is then evaluated as a unary operation, but since `'a'` is not a number, JavaScript tries to convert it which results in a NaN, the JavaScript global property that indicates a failed numeric expression. Then it gets converted to a string, `'NaN'`, to complete the concatenation operation. Phew!

Now we have `'baNaN' + 'a'`, which is the last step of the string concatenation, nothing unusual there.

Last but not least, `'baNaNa'.toLowerCase()` gets rid of the NaN to make the joke less obvious.
